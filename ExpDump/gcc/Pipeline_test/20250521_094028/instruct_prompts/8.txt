INITIAL KNOWLEDGE: The C Standard Library headers provide essential functionalities for system interaction, data manipulation, and program control. Here's a concise breakdown:

**Core Utilities**  
- `<assert.h>`: Debugging via runtime assertions.  
- `<stdlib.h>`: Memory management, random numbers, string conversions.  
- `<stddef.h>`/`<stdarg.h>`: Common macros and variable argument handling.  
- `<limits.h>`/`<float.h>`: Integer and floating-point type limits.  

**I/O & String Handling**  
- `<stdio.h>`: Input/output operations (e.g., `printf`, `scanf`).  
- `<string.h>`: String manipulation (e.g., `strcpy`, `memcmp`).  

**Mathematics**  
- `<math.h>`: Basic math functions (e.g., `sin`, `sqrt`).  
- `<complex.h>` (C99): Complex number arithmetic.  
- `<tgmath.h>` (C99): Type-generic math macros.  

**Type Support**  
- `<stdint.h>` (C99)/`<inttypes.h>` (C99): Fixed-width integers and formatting.  
- `<stdbool.h>` (C99): Boolean type support.  
- `<wchar.h>` (C95)/`<uchar.h>` (C11): Wide/Unicode character handling.  

**Error & Environment**  
- `<errno.h>`: Error code macros.  
- `<fenv.h>` (C99): Floating-point environment control.  

**Concurrency & Atomicity**  
- `<stdatomic.h>` (C11)/`<threads.h>` (C11): Atomic operations and threading.  

**Miscellaneous**  
- `<time.h>`: Time/date utilities.  
- `<locale.h>`: Localization settings.  
- `<signal.h>`: Signal handling.  
- `<setjmp.h>`: Nonlocal jumps.  
- `<iso646.h>` (C95): Alternative operators (e.g., `&&` as `and`).  

**Recent Additions**  
- `<stdbit.h>` (C23)/`<stdckdint.h>` (C23): Bit manipulation and checked integer arithmetic.  

Headers marked with (C99/C11/C23) denote features introduced in later standards beyond ANSI C.
INSTRUCTIONS:
Write a C program that includes the `<stdio.h>` header for input/output operations and uses at least one function from this header, such as `printf`, to display a message to the user.
Include the `<stdio.h>` header in the C program to enable input/output operations.
Include the `<stdlib.h>` header in addition to `<stdio.h>` to utilize memory management functions, and use the `malloc` function to dynamically allocate memory for a string that will be printed using `printf`.
Write a C program that includes the `<stdio.h>` header for input/output operations and uses the `printf` function to display a message to the user, then extend it to include the `<stdlib.h>` header for memory management and utilize the `malloc` function to dynamically allocate memory for a string that will be printed using `printf`, and finally include the `<string.h>` header to perform string manipulation on the allocated string before printing it.

Write a C program that includes the `<stdio.h>` header for input/output operations and uses the `printf` function to display a message to the user.
Include the `<stdio.h>` header in the C program to enable input/output operations and use the `printf` function to display a simple message to the user, then extend it to include the `<stdlib.h>` header for memory management and utilize the `malloc` function to dynamically allocate memory for an integer variable, and store the value 10 in that variable before printing it using `printf`.
Write a C program that includes the `<stdio.h>` header for input/output operations and uses the `printf` function to display a message to the user, then extend it to include the `<stdlib.h>` header for memory management and utilize the `malloc` function to dynamically allocate memory for a structure that contains both an integer and a string, store the value 10 in the integer field and use the `strcpy` function from the `<string.h>` header to copy a predefined string into the string field, and finally use the `printf` function to display both the integer and string values to the user.
TASK: Your task is to generate one short instruction at a time. Each instruction must be description of a specific requirement from the compiler description to be tested. Each instruction must add a new layer of incremental complexity to the existing description of requirements for the generation of C program.
NOTE: DO NOT generate any code. Instructions must be cohesive to guide the generation of single C program.
