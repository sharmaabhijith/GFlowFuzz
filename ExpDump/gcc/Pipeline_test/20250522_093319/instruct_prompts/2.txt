INITIAL KNOWLEDGE: The C Standard Library headers provide essential functionalities for system interaction, data manipulation, and program control. Here's a concise breakdown:

**Core Utilities**  
- `<assert.h>`: Debugging via runtime assertions.  
- `<stdlib.h>`: Memory management, random numbers, string conversions.  
- `<stddef.h>`/`<stdarg.h>`: Common macros and variable argument handling.  
- `<limits.h>`/`<float.h>`: Integer and floating-point type limits.  

**I/O & String Handling**  
- `<stdio.h>`: Input/output operations (e.g., `printf`, `scanf`).  
- `<string.h>`: String manipulation (e.g., `strcpy`, `memcmp`).  

**Mathematics**  
- `<math.h>`: Basic math functions (e.g., `sin`, `sqrt`).  
- `<complex.h>` (C99): Complex number arithmetic.  
- `<tgmath.h>` (C99): Type-generic math macros.  

**Type Support**  
- `<stdint.h>` (C99)/`<inttypes.h>` (C99): Fixed-width integers and formatting.  
- `<stdbool.h>` (C99): Boolean type support.  
- `<wchar.h>` (C95)/`<uchar.h>` (C11): Wide/Unicode character handling.  

**Error & Environment**  
- `<errno.h>`: Error code macros.  
- `<fenv.h>` (C99): Floating-point environment control.  

**Concurrency & Atomicity**  
- `<stdatomic.h>` (C11)/`<threads.h>` (C11): Atomic operations and threading.  

**Miscellaneous**  
- `<time.h>`: Time/date utilities.  
- `<locale.h>`: Localization settings.  
- `<signal.h>`: Signal handling.  
- `<setjmp.h>`: Nonlocal jumps.  
- `<iso646.h>` (C95): Alternative operators (e.g., `&&` as `and`).  

**Recent Additions**  
- `<stdbit.h>` (C23)/`<stdckdint.h>` (C23): Bit manipulation and checked integer arithmetic.  

Headers marked with (C99/C11/C23) denote features introduced in later standards beyond ANSI C.
INSTRUCTIONS:
**Additional Requirement**

**Localization Support**: The compiler must be able to correctly handle localization settings as specified in `<locale.h>`, allowing programs to adapt to different cultural and regional conventions, such as date and time formats, numeric and monetary formats, and character encoding.
**Additional Requirement**

**Error Handling and Reporting**: The compiler must be able to correctly utilize the error code macros defined in `<errno.h>` to report and handle runtime errors, ensuring that programs can accurately identify and respond to system errors and exceptional conditions.
**Additional Requirement**

**Mathematical Functionality**: The compiler must be able to correctly implement the basic math functions defined in `<math.h>`, ensuring that programs can accurately perform common mathematical operations such as trigonometric calculations, exponential and logarithmic functions, and power and root calculations.
**Additional Requirement**

**String Manipulation**: The compiler must be able to correctly implement the string manipulation functions defined in `<string.h>`, allowing programs to accurately perform common string operations such as copying, concatenation, comparison, and searching.
**Additional Requirement**

**Input/Output Operations**: The compiler must be able to correctly implement the input/output operations defined in `<stdio.h>`, ensuring that programs can accurately perform common I/O operations such as reading and writing to files, console input/output, and formatted output using functions like `printf` and `scanf`.
**Additional Requirement**

**Assertion Support**: The compiler must be able to correctly handle runtime assertions as specified in `<assert.h>`, allowing programs to verify assumptions and detect errors during execution, and ensuring that assertion failures result in a well-defined behavior, such as program termination or error reporting.
**Additional Requirement**

**Type-Generic Math Macros**: The compiler must be able to correctly implement the type-generic math macros defined in `<tgmath.h>`, ensuring that programs can accurately perform mathematical operations on different data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers, without requiring explicit type casting or separate function calls for each type.
**Additional Requirement**

**Concurrency and Atomicity Support**: The compiler must be able to correctly implement the atomic operations and threading functions defined in `<stdatomic.h>` and `<threads.h>`, ensuring that programs can accurately perform concurrent and parallel operations, and utilize atomic variables to synchronize access to shared data in a thread-safe manner.
**Additional Requirement**

**Wide Character Handling**: The compiler must be able to correctly implement the wide character handling functions defined in `<wchar.h>`, allowing programs to accurately perform operations on wide characters, such as reading and writing wide characters to files, console input/output, and string manipulation, ensuring proper support for Unicode and other wide character encodings.
**Additional Requirement**

**Fixed-Width Integer Support**: The compiler must be able to correctly implement the fixed-width integer types and formatting functions defined in `<stdint.h>` and `<inttypes.h>`, ensuring that programs can accurately perform operations on integers of specific widths, such as 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit integers, and utilize the corresponding formatting macros to accurately print and scan these integers.
