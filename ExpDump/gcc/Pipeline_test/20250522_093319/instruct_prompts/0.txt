INITIAL KNOWLEDGE: The C Standard Library headers provide essential functionalities for system interaction, data manipulation, and program control. Here's a concise breakdown:

**Core Utilities**  
- `<assert.h>`: Debugging via runtime assertions.  
- `<stdlib.h>`: Memory management, random numbers, string conversions.  
- `<stddef.h>`/`<stdarg.h>`: Common macros and variable argument handling.  
- `<limits.h>`/`<float.h>`: Integer and floating-point type limits.  

**I/O & String Handling**  
- `<stdio.h>`: Input/output operations (e.g., `printf`, `scanf`).  
- `<string.h>`: String manipulation (e.g., `strcpy`, `memcmp`).  

**Mathematics**  
- `<math.h>`: Basic math functions (e.g., `sin`, `sqrt`).  
- `<complex.h>` (C99): Complex number arithmetic.  
- `<tgmath.h>` (C99): Type-generic math macros.  

**Type Support**  
- `<stdint.h>` (C99)/`<inttypes.h>` (C99): Fixed-width integers and formatting.  
- `<stdbool.h>` (C99): Boolean type support.  
- `<wchar.h>` (C95)/`<uchar.h>` (C11): Wide/Unicode character handling.  

**Error & Environment**  
- `<errno.h>`: Error code macros.  
- `<fenv.h>` (C99): Floating-point environment control.  

**Concurrency & Atomicity**  
- `<stdatomic.h>` (C11)/`<threads.h>` (C11): Atomic operations and threading.  

**Miscellaneous**  
- `<time.h>`: Time/date utilities.  
- `<locale.h>`: Localization settings.  
- `<signal.h>`: Signal handling.  
- `<setjmp.h>`: Nonlocal jumps.  
- `<iso646.h>` (C95): Alternative operators (e.g., `&&` as `and`).  

**Recent Additions**  
- `<stdbit.h>` (C23)/`<stdckdint.h>` (C23): Bit manipulation and checked integer arithmetic.  

Headers marked with (C99/C11/C23) denote features introduced in later standards beyond ANSI C.
INSTRUCTIONS:
**Additional Requirement**

**Mandatory Header Inclusion**: The compiler must be able to successfully compile a program that includes all the standard library headers listed above (from `<assert.h>` to `<stdckdint.h>`) in a single source file, without any conflicts or redefinition errors. This test ensures that the compiler correctly handles multiple header inclusions and provides all the necessary functionalities to the user.
**Header Compatibility Requirement**

The compiler must ensure that the inclusion of any standard library header does not introduce naming conflicts or redefine existing macros and functions, allowing a program to simultaneously include all headers from `<assert.h>` to `<stdckdint.h>` without compilation errors.
**Mathematical Function Precision Requirement**

The compiler must ensure that the mathematical functions provided in `<math.h>`, `<complex.h>`, and `<tgmath.h>` headers maintain the minimum precision and accuracy as specified by the C standard, including but not limited to trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic, and power functions, for both real and complex numbers, across all supported data types.
**Atomicity and Thread Safety Requirement**

The compiler must ensure that the atomic operations and threading functions provided in `<stdatomic.h>` and `<threads.h>` headers guarantee thread safety and atomicity, allowing multiple threads to access and modify shared variables without introducing data races or inconsistencies, and providing a way to synchronize thread execution and communicate between threads.
**Time and Date Functionality Requirement**

The compiler must ensure that the time and date functions provided in `<time.h>` header correctly handle and manipulate time and date information, including but not limited to retrieving the current time, converting between time formats, and calculating time differences, and provide a way to handle leap seconds and daylight saving time adjustments.
**Localization Setting Requirement**

The compiler must ensure that the localization functions provided in `<locale.h>` header correctly handle and manage locale-specific settings, including but not limited to setting and retrieving the current locale, converting between character encodings, and formatting numeric and monetary values according to the selected locale, without introducing any inconsistencies or errors.
**Signal Handling Robustness Requirement**

The compiler must ensure that the signal handling functions provided in `<signal.h>` header can correctly handle and manage signals, including but not limited to installing signal handlers, blocking and unblocking signals, and ensuring that signal handlers are executed correctly in the presence of other signals, without introducing any data corruption or inconsistencies, and providing a way to access and manipulate signal masks and pending signals.
**Error Handling and Reporting Requirement**

The compiler must ensure that the error handling functions provided in `<errno.h>` header correctly report and manage error conditions, including but not limited to setting and retrieving error codes, providing human-readable error messages, and preserving error information across function calls and threads, allowing the program to diagnose and handle runtime errors in a robust and reliable manner.
**Floating-Point Environment Control Requirement**

The compiler must ensure that the floating-point environment control functions provided in `<fenv.h>` header correctly handle and manage the floating-point environment, including but not limited to setting and retrieving the floating-point rounding mode, enabling and disabling floating-point exceptions, and providing a way to access and manipulate the floating-point status flags, without introducing any inconsistencies or errors, and allowing the program to control and adapt to the floating-point environment as needed.
**Wide Character Handling Requirement**

The compiler must ensure that the wide character handling functions provided in `<wchar.h>` header correctly handle and manipulate wide characters, including but not limited to reading and writing wide characters, converting between wide and narrow characters, and determining the properties of wide characters, without introducing any inconsistencies or errors, and providing a way to handle and process wide character strings and streams in a way that is consistent with the C standard.
