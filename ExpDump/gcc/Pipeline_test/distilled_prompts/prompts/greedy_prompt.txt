The C Standard Library is a collection of headers that provide a wide range of functionalities. Here's a concise summary:

**Functionality Categories**

1. **Error Handling**: `<assert.h>`, `<errno.h>`, `<stdckdint.h>` (checked integer arithmetic)
2. **Type and Character Utilities**: `<ctype.h>`, `<stdbool.h>`, `<wctype.h>` (character type determination)
3. **Integer and Floating-Point Types**: `<limits.h>`, `<float.h>`, `<stdint.h>` (type limits and definitions)
4. **Mathematics and Numerics**: `<math.h>`, `<complex.h>`, `<tgmath.h>` (mathematical functions)
5. **Input/Output and Strings**: `<stdio.h>`, `<string.h>`, `<wchar.h>` (input/output and string handling)
6. **Memory Management and Utilities**: `<stdlib.h>` (memory management, program utilities, etc.)
7. **Concurrency and Threading**: `<threads.h>`, `<stdatomic.h>` (thread library and atomic operations)
8. **Localization and Time/Date Utilities**: `<locale.h>`, `<time.h>` (localization and time/date utilities)
9. **Miscellaneous**: `<setjmp.h>`, `<signal.h>`, `<stdalign.h>`, `<stdarg.h>`, `<stdnoreturn.h>` (nonlocal jumps, signal handling, etc.)

**Key Features**

* Provides a standard interface for various tasks, such as input/output, mathematics, and memory management.
* Offers a range of data types and functions for working with integers, floating-point numbers, and characters.
* Supports concurrency and threading through `<threads.h>` and `<stdatomic.h>`.
* Includes utilities for localization, time/date manipulation, and error handling.

Overall, the C Standard Library is a comprehensive collection of headers that provide a foundation for writing efficient, portable, and reliable C code.
