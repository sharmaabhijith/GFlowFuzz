The C Standard Library is a collection of headers that provide various functionalities for C programming. Here's a concise summary:

**Functionality Categories:**

1. **Error Handling**: `<assert.h>`, `<errno.h>`, `<stdckdint.h>` for error reporting and handling.
2. **Type Support**: `<ctype.h>`, `<stdbool.h>`, `<stddef.h>`, `<stdint.h>`, `<wctype.h>` for working with different data types.
3. **Math and Numerics**: `<complex.h>`, `<fenv.h>`, `<float.h>`, `<math.h>`, `<tgmath.h>` for mathematical operations.
4. **Input/Output**: `<stdio.h>`, `<wchar.h>` for input/output operations.
5. **String and Character Processing**: `<string.h>`, `<wchar.h>`, `<wctype.h>` for string and character manipulation.
6. **Memory Management**: `<stdlib.h>` for memory management and general utilities.
7. **Concurrency and Threading**: `<threads.h>`, `<stdatomic.h>` for concurrent programming.
8. **Time and Date**: `<time.h>` for time and date utilities.
9. **Localization**: `<locale.h>` for localization utilities.

**Key Features:**

* Provides a wide range of functionalities for C programming.
* Headers are categorized into different functionality areas.
* Supports various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, and characters.
* Offers utilities for error handling, memory management, and concurrent programming.

**Usage:**
