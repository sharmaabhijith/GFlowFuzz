{"API": "torch.distributed.distributed_c10d._abort_process_group", "Bug Description": "Aborting distributed backend causes segmentation fault in autograd", "Instructions": "1. Import `torch` and sub‑modules needed for `torch.distributed.distributed_c10d._abort_process_group` along with helpers for environment diagnostics.\n2. Print Python, PyTorch and device details (including CUDA availability) to contextualise the run.\n3. Fix random seeds on CPU and (if used) GPU to keep results deterministic.\n4. Create minimal input tensors that satisfy shape and dtype requirements for the bug demonstration.\n5. Move the tensors or model to **CUDA** to replicate the GPU code‑path implicated in the bug.\n6.
