The C Standard Library is a collection of headers that provide a wide range of functionalities. Here's a concise summary:

**Functionality Categories:**

1. **Error Handling**: `<assert.h>`, `<errno.h>`, `<stdckdint.h>` (checked integer arithmetic)
2. **Type and Data Utilities**: `<ctype.h>`, `<wctype.h>`, `<stdbool.h>`, `<stddef.h>`, `<stdint.h>`, `<stdalign.h>`
3. **Math and Numerics**: `<math.h>`, `<complex.h>`, `<tgmath.h>`, `<fenv.h>`, `<float.h>`, `<limits.h>`
4. **Input/Output and Strings**: `<stdio.h>`, `<string.h>`, `<wchar.h>`, `<uchar.h>`
5. **Memory and Process Management**: `<stdlib.h>`, `<setjmp.h>`, `<signal.h>`, `<threads.h>`
6. **Localization and Time/Date**: `<locale.h>`, `<time.h>`

**Key Features:**

* Provides a standard interface for various tasks, such as input/output, math operations, and memory management.
* Offers a range of data types and utilities, including integer and floating-point types, character and string handling, and boolean values.
* Supports error handling and reporting through macros and functions.
* Includes features for working with threads, signals, and nonlocal jumps.

**Usage:**

* Include the relevant header(s) for the desired functionality.
* Use the provided macros, functions, and data types to perform the required tasks.
* Follow the C standard library's conventions and guidelines for usage.
