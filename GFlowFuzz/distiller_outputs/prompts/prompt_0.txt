The C Standard Library is a collection of headers that provide a wide range of functionalities. The library is divided into several categories, including:

1. **Error Handling and Diagnostics**:
	* `<assert.h>`: Conditionally compiled macro for debugging
	* `<errno.h>`: Macros for reporting error conditions
	* `<signal.h>`: Signal handling
2. **Data Types and Utilities**:
	* `<ctype.h>`: Character type classification
	* `<stdbool.h>`: Boolean type macros
	* `<stddef.h>`: Common macro definitions
	* `<stdint.h>`: Fixed-width integer types
	* `<inttypes.h>`: Format conversion of integer types
3. **Mathematics and Numerics**:
	* `<complex.h>`: Complex number arithmetic
	* `<fenv.h>`: Floating-point environment
	* `<float.h>`: Limits of floating-point types
	* `<math.h>`: Common mathematics functions
	* `<tgmath.h>`: Type-generic math macros
4. **Memory Management and Algorithms**:
	* `<stdlib.h>`: General utilities, including memory management and algorithms
	* `<string.h>`: String handling
	* `<wchar.h>`: Extended multibyte and wide character utilities
	* `<wctype.h>`: Wide character type classification
5. **Concurrency and Threading**:
	* `<threads.h>`: Thread library
	* `<stdatomic.h>`: Atomic operations
6. **Input/Output and Localization**:
	* `<stdio.h>`: Input/output functions
	* `<locale.h>`: Localization utilities
	* `<time.h>`: Time and date utilities
7. **Miscellaneous**:
	* `<iso646.h>`: Alternative operator spellings
	* `<setjmp.h>`: Nonlocal jumps
	* `<stdalign.h>`: Alignment convenience macros
	* `<stdarg.h>`: Variable arguments
	* `<stdckdint.h>`: Checked integer arithmetic macros
	* `<stdnoreturn.h>`: Noreturn convenience macro
	* `<uchar.h>`: UTF-16 and UTF-32 character utilities
	* `<stdbit.h>`: Macros to work with the byte and bit representations of types

These headers provide a comprehensive set of functionalities for C programming, covering areas such as error handling, data types, mathematics, memory management, concurrency, input/output, and localization.
