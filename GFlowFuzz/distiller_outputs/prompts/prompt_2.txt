The C Standard Library is a collection of headers that provide a wide range of functionalities. Here's a concise summary:

**Main Functionalities:**

1. **Error Handling**: `<assert.h>`, `<errno.h>`, `<stdbool.h>`
2. **Mathematical Operations**: `<math.h>`, `<complex.h>`, `<tgmath.h>`
3. **Input/Output**: `<stdio.h>`, `<wchar.h>`
4. **Memory Management**: `<stdlib.h>`, `<string.h>`
5. **Multithreading**: `<threads.h>`, `<stdatomic.h>`
6. **Time and Date**: `<time.h>`
7. **Character and String Utilities**: `<ctype.h>`, `<wctype.h>`, `<string.h>`, `<wchar.h>`, `<uchar.h>`
8. **Integer and Floating-Point Types**: `<limits.h>`, `<float.h>`, `<stdint.h>`, `<inttypes.h>`

**Key Features:**

* Provides functions for tasks such as input/output, memory management, mathematical operations, and character/string manipulation.
* Offers various data types and macros for working with integers, floating-point numbers, and characters.
* Supports multithreading and atomic operations.
* Includes utilities for time and date manipulation.
* Allows for localization and internationalization through `<locale.h>`.

**Usage:**

* Include the relevant header(s) to use the desired functionality.
* Follow the documentation for each header to use the provided functions and macros correctly.

Overall, the C Standard Library provides a comprehensive set of functionalities that are essential for building robust and efficient C programs.
